This Java project with Spring Boot that I implemented. A user and department system (REST API) has a mechanism to find all registered users by their ID.
The goals were to program based on the flowchart model, implementing Java language methods (object-oriented programming), object-relational mapping with JPA, configuring the H2 database, endpoints. Transferring and displaying related data in JSON format in Postman, serializing user data to JSON format, and deserializing it for department data and function.
The sts used were Spring Tool Suite and Postman.
